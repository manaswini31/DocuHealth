the patient may complain of external or internal nose disorders. Deformities of normal contour or lesions on the skin of the nose may cause the patient to seek a medical opinion.

Internal nose (nasal cavity) complaints are the most common of all human ills (sinus trouble, hay fever, runny nose, catarrh, postnasal drip, congestion, colds, blockage, and many others).
